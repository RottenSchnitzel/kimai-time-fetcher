# Kimai Time Fetcher
This little python script uses Kimai's API for putting the current worktime into a file.

## Usage
Just put your username and API access token into the .env file and you can run the skript. Run it manually first in order to check weither the request works. In case a number gets printed this is the response status of the kimai page. If everything works no output is generated.

Don't forget: the default path to the active timesheets is /api/timesheets/active

## Example Setup (i3status)
